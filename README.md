### KelechiKenz  
#### A repo that is deployed to an EC2 instance and displays some web contents after deployment is done  
#### http://54.75.94.246/  


## Task 2
Task 2 focused on writing a script that takes inputs from users and deploys a containerized app on a cloud provider or locally. The script is to be idempotent and printout errors where necessary.
##### Gains
From doing the task, I sharpened my bash script skills. I learned a few new things like basename, #http:// (This removes http links from a URL) and tag:-new-tag(This means use tag but if tag doesn't exist, use new-tag)

## Task 3
This task showed blue-green approach to deployments. Basically using Nginx as an ALB instead of AWS ALB. We switched traffic between 2 identical Nodejs apps.
**ALB- Aplication Load Balancer**
